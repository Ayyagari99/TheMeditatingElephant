# TheMeditatingElephant
The Meditating Elephant is an 'Action on Google'. <br />
It has been officially launched to all the Google Assistant users, on all devices.<br />

To access it, take a device with the Google Assistant. Then say,  <br />
"OK Google" <br />
"Talk to The Meditating Elephant" <br />

It is a simple game to practice some intriguing combinatorics questions. <br />
The Meditating Elephant was built on the 'Actions Console', which is the platform for developers to extend the Google Assistant.





And Amandeep, Drishti, Divya and Swapniil bhaiya, thanks a ton for being the cool Beta users! :)
