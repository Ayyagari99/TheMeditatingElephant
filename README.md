# The Meditating Elephant
The Meditating Elephant is an 'Action on Google'. <br />
It has been officially launched to all the Google Assistant users, on all devices.<br />

To access it, take a device with the Google Assistant. Then say,  <br />
"OK Google" <br />
"Talk to The Meditating Elephant" <br />

It is a simple game to practice some intriguing combinatorics questions. <br />
The Meditating Elephant was built on the 'Actions Console', which is the platform for developers to extend the Google Assistant.

# In Action:
These is the main page:

When the snake/array hits the outline of the page, the game ends:

Big thanks to the Beta users: Amandeep Kaur, Drishti Gupta, Divya Pant, Swapniil Kanwar.
Would also like to thank the resources on Youtube and Stack Overflow always! :)

# A Small Catch:
The game does not end when the snake hits itself. <br />
This part is yet to be developed. <br />
